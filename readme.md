Mass Effect 5e Conversion for Fantasy Grounds

# Introduction

This mod only aims to make using fantasy grounds easier for anyone following the Mass Effect conversion rules.  Feel free to submit issues if you notice something is wrong and I will work to fix it as soon as possible.

# Installation

1. Go to the [latest release](https://github.com/stygiansabyss/mass-effect-5e-fantasy-grounds-mod/releases/latest).
2. Download the `mass_effect_5e.mod` file.
3. Do not extract or modify the mod file.  This is the format Fantasy Grounds wants the zip in.  You can look through the contents yourself by just renaming the extension to `.zip`.
4. Put the `.mod` file in `<DRIVE>:\Users\<USER>\AppData\Roaming\SmiteWorks\Fantasy Grounds\modules`.
5. Start up Fantasy grounds and you should see the mod for any DND 5e rules game.
6. Click on Library > Modules > Activation.
7. Find Mass Effect 5e and load it.

# Other things you can do

1. Once in your game, go to options.  Click the currencies button.
    1. Remove all but GP.
    2. Rename GP to Credits.
2. Until I get the extension to do it, the module does not automatically load the new skills onto the character sheet.
	1. For each character sheet, open the Character > Skills window (in the right side menu) and drag the following skills on to the character sheet.
		1. Electronics
		2. Engineering
		3. Science
		4. Vehicle Handling
3. Grab the extension
	1. I am working on an extension to add more of the rules directly into Fantasy Grounds.  You can find it [here on github](https://github.com/stygiansabyss/mass-effect-5e-fantasy-grounds-ext).
