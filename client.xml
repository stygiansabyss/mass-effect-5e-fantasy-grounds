							<p>You were the subject of experimentation in your youth, with the goal of stripping away the old you and turning you into a weapon. The program could have been funded by your species' government, a shadow organization, or a single mad scientist who kidnapped you. It could have had the goal of turning you into the ultimate soldier, perhaps an unrivaled biotic, or even a genius tech engineer.</p>
							<p />
							<p>Regardless of the program's nature or success, you survived your difficult trials and came out tougher for it. You've been pushed to the edge of death before, so it doesn't scare you. Once per long rest, you can choose to make a death saving throw with advantage due to your strong drive to survive.</p>

							<p>As an action or bonus action, you create a biotic barrier around you that reduces incoming damage and fuels certain biotic abilities. You gain barrier ticks equal to the Barrier Ticks column shown on your class progression table. Your total barrier ticks cannot exceed the amount listed in the Barrier Ticks column of your class progression table, and any barrier ticks gained in excess of this number are lost.</p>
							<p />
							<p>Whenever you would take damage while barrier is active, remove 1 barrier tick and reduce the damage by 1d8. Then, apply any remaining damage to other hit pools like tech armor, shields, temporary hit points, or hit points.</p>
							<p />
							<p>Barrier lasts 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or have no barrier ticks remaining. You can also end barrier at any time as a free action. When Barrier ends, you lose any remaining barrier ticks.</p>
							<p />
							<p>Once you have used barrier the maximum number of times for your combined Adept, Explorer, Sentinel, and/or Vanguard levels, you must finish a short rest before you can use it again. You may use barrier 2 times at 1st level, 3 at 3rd, 4 at 6th, 5 at 12th, and 6 at 17th.</p>

							<h>Preparing and casting powers</h>
							<p>The Engineer table shows how many tech points you have to cast your powers of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these engineer powers, you must expend a number of tech points equal to the power&#8217;s level or higher. You regain all expended tech points when you finish a long rest.</p>
							<p />
							<p>You are limited in the number of tech points you can spend to cast a power as indicated in the Tech Point Limit column of the Engineer table.</p>
							<p />
							<p>For example, a 9th-level engineer can cast powers for 1, 2, or 3 tech points.</p>
							<p />
							<p>You prepare the list of engineer powers that are available for you to cast, choosing from the engineer power list. When you do so, choose a number of engineer powers equal to your Intelligence modifier + your engineer level (minimum of one power).</p>
							<p />
							<p>You may prepare the advanced version of a power for the cost of 2 regular versions. Whenever you cast the power, you cast the advanced version of it. You may only prepare one advanced version for each power.</p>
							<p />
							<p>For example, if you are a 4th-level engineer with an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared powers can be one of the following:</p>
							<p />
							<p>seven regular powers</p>
							<p>one advanced power and five regular powers,</p>
							<p>two advanced powers and three regular powers,</p>
							<p>three advanced powers and one regular power</p>
							<p />
							<p>You can also change your list of prepared powers when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of engineer powers requires time spent to program them into your omni-tool: at least 1 minute per power level for each power on your list.</p>
							<p />
							<h>Powercasting Ability</h>
							<p>Engineers use a highly modified Omni-tool that requires a keen intellect to maintain. As an engineer, you use your Intelligence whenever a power refers to your powercasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a tech power you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
							<p />
							<p>Power save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>
							<p />
							<p>Power attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>
							<p />

							<p />
							<p>When summoned, the drone has additional hit points equal to twice your engineer level. Whenever the drone makes a saving throw, damage or healing roll, add your proficiency bonus to the roll. Whenever the drone attacks, apply your proficiency bonus instead of the drone's to the roll.</p>

							<p>You have complete control over the drone. Any hacking attempts on the drone are rolled against your Intelligence, not the drone's. The drone has its own turn in the initiative order, which occurs immediately following your turn.</p>

							<p>You've bolstered your armor with a powerful, defense-oriented AI. As a bonus action or as a reaction to taking damage, activate your Tech Armor.</p>

							<p>When activated, tech armor creates a new kinetic barrier with additional hit points equal to the sum of your sentinel level and powercasting modifier, multiplied by 2. When you have tech armor hit points and take damage, the tech armor hit points are lost first, and any leftover damage carries over to your shields and/or normal hit points. Tech armor lasts 1 minute or until it has 0 hit points remaining.</p>
							<p />
							<p>While tech armor is active, you can use your action to overload it. Each creature within 10 feet must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes force damage equal to the remaining hit points of your tech armor, or half as much on a successful one.</p>

							<h>Cantrips</h>
							<p>You know two cantrips of your choice from the sentinel power list. You learn additional sentinel cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Sentinel table.</p>
							<p />
							<p>Instead of learning a new cantrip, you may instead learn the advanced version of a cantrip you already know.</p>
							<p />
							<h>Power Slots</h>
							<p>The Sentinel table shows how many power slots you have. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your power slots are the same level. To cast one of your sentinel powers of 1st level or higher, you must expend a power slot. You regain all expended power slots when you finish a short or long rest.</p>
							<p />
							<p>For example, when you are 5th level, you have two 2nd-level power slots. To cast the 1st-level power lance, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 2nd-level power.</p>
							<p />
							<h>Powers Known of 1st Level and Higher</h>
							<p>At 1st level, you know two 1st-level powers of your choice from the sentinel power list.</p>
							<p />
							<p>The powers Known column of the Sentinel table shows when you learn more sentinel powers of your choice of 1st level and higher. A power you choose must be of a level no higher than what's shown in the table's Slot Level column for your level. When you reach 5th level, for example, you learn a new sentinel power, which can be 1st or 2nd level.</p>
							<p />
							<p>Additionally, when you learn a new power, you may instead choose one of the powers you know and learn an advanced version of it. You select one of the advancement options listed in the power description. Whenever you cast the power, you cast the advanced version of it. You can only learn one advancement for each power.</p>
							<p />
							<h>Powercasting Ability</h>
							<p>Sentinels use a unique L5t biotic implant that integrates with the operative's omni-tool maximizes their innate talents. As a sentinel you choose either Intelligence or Wisdom as your powercasting modifier.</p>
							<p />
							<p>Choosing Intelligence means that your operative takes advantage of their omni-tool, using it to assist in the casting of biotic powers. Their keen intellect helps them choose strategic targets to maximize the potency of their powers.</p>
							<p>Choosing Wisdom means that your operative has unmatched concentration and can use the physical mnemonics of their biotic implant to cast tech powers with their omni-tool. Their patience and insight maximizes the potency of their powers.</p>
							<p>You use your selected ability whenever a power refers to your powercasting ability. In addition, you use your selected ability's modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a power you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
							<p />
							<p>Power save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your selected ability modifier</p>
							<p />
							<p>Power attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your selected ability modifier</p>

							<p>As an action or bonus action, you create a biotic barrier around you that reduces incoming damage and fuels certain biotic abilities. You gain barrier ticks equal to the Barrier Ticks column shown on your class progression table. Your total barrier ticks cannot exceed the amount listed in the Barrier Ticks column of your class progression table, and any barrier ticks gained in excess of this number are lost.</p>
							<p />
							<p>Whenever you would take damage while barrier is active, remove 1 barrier tick and reduce the damage by 1d8. Then, apply any remaining damage to other hit pools like tech armor, shields, temporary hit points, or hit points.</p>
							<p />
							<p>Barrier lasts 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or have no barrier ticks remaining. You can also end barrier at any time as a free action. When Barrier ends, you lose any remaining barrier ticks.</p>
							<p />
							<p>Once you have used barrier the maximum number of times for your combined Adept, Explorer, Sentinel, and/or Vanguard levels, you must finish a short rest before you can use it again. You may use barrier 2 times at 1st level, 3 at 3rd, 4 at 6th, 5 at 12th, and 6 at 17th.</p>

							<h>Cantrips</h>
							<p>At 1st level, you know four cantrips of your choice from the vanguard power list. You learn additional vanguard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Vanguard table.</p>
							<p />
							<p>Instead of learning a new cantrip, you may instead learn the advanced version of a cantrip you already know.</p>
							<p />
							<h>Power Slots</h>
							<p>The Vanguard table shows how many power slots you have to cast your powers of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these vanguard powers, you must expend a slot of the power&#8217;s level or higher. You regain all expended power slots when you finish a long rest.</p>
							<p />
							<p>For example, if you know the 1st-level power lance and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level power slot available, you can cast lance using either slot.</p>
							<p />
							<h>Powers Known of 1st Level and Higher</h>
							<p>Starting at 2nd level, you know two 1st-level powers of your choice from the vanguard power list.</p>
							<p />
							<p>The powers Known column of the Vanguard table shows when you learn more vanguard powers of your choice. Each of these powers must be of a level for which you have power slots. For instance, when you reach 9th level in this class, you can learn one new power of 1st or 2nd level.</p>
							<p />
							<p>Additionally, when you learn a new power, you may instead choose one of the powers you know and learn an advanced version of it. You select one of the advancement options listed in the power description. Whenever you cast the power, you cast the advanced version of it. You can only learn one advancement for each power.</p>
							<p />
							<h>Powercasting Ability</h>
							<p>Vanguards are outfitted with the L5n biotic implant which draws upon their inner strength of will and focus on their physical mnemonics. As a vanguard, you use your Wisdom whenever a power refers to your powercasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a biotic power you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
							<p />
							<p>Power save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>
							<p />
							<p>Power attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>
							<p />
							<p>
								<b>Spellcasting Ability</b>
							</p>
							<p>Wisdom is your spellcasting ability.</p>

							<p>At 1st level, choose a fighting style from the list below.</p>
							<p />
							<p>
								<b>Ambidextrous </b>. When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.</p>
							<p />
							<p>
								<b>Assault </b>. When you make a Burst Fire attack, increase the DC by 2.</p>
							<p />
							<p>
								<b>Brawler </b>. Add your proficiency bonus to your melee attack damage rolls.</p>
							<p />
							<p>
								<b>Carnage </b>. When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a shotgun, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll.</p>
							<p />
							<p>
								<b>Close-Quarters Shooter </b>. When making a ranged attack while you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature, you do not have disadvantage on the attack roll. Your ranged attacks ignore half-cover against targets within 30 feet of you.</p>
							<p />
							<p>
								<b>Defense </b>. +1 AC.</p>
							<p />
							<p>
								<b>The Free Hand </b>. When holding no more than one light, non-two-handed weapon, you gain a +2 bonus to hit with ranged power attacks.</p>
							<p />
							<p>
								<b>Protection </b>. When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction and expend one barrier tick to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. If the attack hits, the damage is reduced by your barrier tick roll.</p>
							<p />
							<p>
								<b>Sniper </b>. If no hostile creature is within 30 feet of you, gain +2 to damage rolls on attacks made with a sniper rifle.</p>

						<specializationchoice type="number">0</specializationchoice>
						<text type="formattedtext">
							<p>As an action or bonus action, you create a biotic barrier around you that reduces incoming damage and fuels certain biotic abilities. You gain barrier ticks equal to the Barrier Ticks column shown on your class progression table. Your total barrier ticks cannot exceed the amount listed in the Barrier Ticks column of your class progression table, and any barrier ticks gained in excess of this number are lost.</p>
							<p />
							<p>Whenever you would take damage while barrier is active, remove 1 barrier tick and reduce the damage by 1d8. Then, apply any remaining damage to other hit pools like tech armor, shields, temporary hit points, or hit points.</p>
							<p />
							<p>Barrier lasts 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or have no barrier ticks remaining. You can also end barrier at any time as a free action. When Barrier ends, you lose any remaining barrier ticks.</p>
							<p />
							<p>Once you have used barrier the maximum number of times for your combined Adept, Explorer, Sentinel, and/or Vanguard levels, you must finish a short rest before you can use it again. You may use barrier 2 times at 1st level, 3 at 3rd, 4 at 6th, 5 at 12th, and 6 at 17th.</p>

						<specializationchoice type="number">0</specializationchoice>
						<text type="formattedtext">
							<p>As an action or bonus action, you create a biotic barrier around you that reduces incoming damage and fuels certain biotic abilities. You gain barrier ticks equal to the Barrier Ticks column shown on your class progression table. Your total barrier ticks cannot exceed the amount listed in the Barrier Ticks column of your class progression table, and any barrier ticks gained in excess of this number are lost.</p>
							<p />
							<p>Whenever you would take damage while barrier is active, remove 1 barrier tick and reduce the damage by 1d8. Then, apply any remaining damage to other hit pools like tech armor, shields, temporary hit points, or hit points.</p>
							<p />
							<p>Barrier lasts 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or have no barrier ticks remaining. You can also end barrier at any time as a free action. When Barrier ends, you lose any remaining barrier ticks.</p>
							<p />
							<p>Once you have used barrier the maximum number of times for your combined Adept, Explorer, Sentinel, and/or Vanguard levels, you must finish a short rest before you can use it again. You may use barrier 2 times at 1st level, 3 at 3rd, 4 at 5th, 5 at 10th, and 6 at 17th.</p>

							<h>Preparing and casting powers</h>
							<p>The Musician table shows how many tech points you have to cast your powers of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these musician powers, you must expend a number of tech points equal to the power&#8217;s level or higher. You regain all expended tech points when you finish a long rest.</p>
							<p />
							<p>You are limited in the number of tech points you can spend to cast a power as indicated in the Tech Point Limit column of the Musician table.</p>
							<p />
							<p>For example, a 9th-level musician can cast powers for 1, or 2 tech points.</p>
							<p />
							<p>You prepare the list of musician powers that are available for you to cast, choosing from the musician power list. When you do so, choose a number of musician powers equal to your Charisma modifier + your musician level (minimum of one power).</p>
							<p />
							<p>You may prepare the advanced version of a power for the cost of 2 regular versions. You may only prepare one advanced version for each power.</p>
							<p />
							<p>For example, if you are a 4th-level musician with a Charisma of 16, your list of prepared powers can be one of the following:</p>
							<p />
							<p>seven regular powers</p>
							<p>one advanced power and five regular powers</p>
							<p>two advanced powers and three regular powers</p>
							<p>three advanced powers and one regular power</p>
							<p />
							<p>You can also change your list of prepared powers when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of musician powers requires time spent to program them into your omni-tool: at least 1 minute per power level for each power on your list.</p>
							<p />
							<h>Powercasting Ability</h>
							<p>As a musician, you use your Charisma whenever a power refers to your powercasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a tech power you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
							<p />
							<p>Power save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>
							<p />
							<p>Power attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>

							<h>Preparing and casting powers</h>
							<p>The Tracker table shows how many tech points you have to cast your powers of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these Tracker powers, you must expend a number of tech points equal to the power&#8217;s level or higher. You regain all expended tech points when you finish a long rest.</p>
							<p />
							<p>You are limited in the number of tech points you can spend to cast a power as indicated in the Tech Point Limit column of the Tracker table.</p>
							<p />
							<p>For example, a 9th-level Tracker can cast powers for 1 or 2 tech points.</p>
							<p />
							<p>You prepare the list of Tracker powers that are available for you to cast, choosing from the Tracker power list. When you do so, choose a number of Tracker powers equal to your powercasting modifier + half your Tracker level (minimum of one power).</p>
							<p />
							<p>You may prepare the advanced version of a power for the cost of 2 regular versions. Whenever you cast the power, you cast the advanced version of it. You may only prepare one advanced version for each power.</p>
							<p />
							<p>For example, if you are a 9th-level Tracker with a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared powers can be one of the following:</p>
							<p />
							<p>seven regular powers</p>
							<p>one advanced power and five regular powers,</p>
							<p>two advanced powers and three regular powers,</p>
							<p>three advanced powers and one regular power</p>
							<p />
							<p>You can also change your list of prepared powers when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of Tracker powers requires time spent to program them into your omni-tool: at least 1 minute per power level for each power on your list.</p>
							<p />
							<h>Powercasting Ability</h>
							<p>Trackers use a modified omni-tool with certain pre-programmed powers. The use and maintenance is a rather simple concept, and it can be used in various ways. As a tracker, you select an ability from Intelligence, Wisdom or Charisma. You use this ability score whenever a power refers to your powercasting ability. In addition, you use the modifier of that score when setting the saving throw DC for a tech power you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
							<p />
							<p>Power save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your selected ability modifier</p>
							<p />
							<p>Power attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your selected ability modifier</p>
							<p />

						<text type="formattedtext">
							<p>The most crucial part of any tracker. Starting at level 1, you gain a special beast companion, one that you perhaps created yourself, bought at an auction, got assigned to you, or found in the wild and tamed yourself. Choose the type of animal companion from Synthetic, Brute, All-Round, and Recon. If you choose All-Round, you may also select a type of movement speed from Swimming, Burrowing and Climbing. Your beast gains a swimming or climbing speed equal to its walking speed, or Burrowing equal to half.</p>
							<p />
							<p>The stat blocks for the beast companions can be found in the bestiary.</p>
							<p />
							<p>The beast obeys your commands as best as it can. It moves on your turn. You can command it to move however you want (No action required). You can use a bonus action to command it to Hide, Dodge, Dash or Disengage.</p>
							<p />
							<p>To command it to attack, you must use your action to do so. You may only give one command to your beast per turn. For example, if you command your beast to Hide using your bonus action, you may no longer order it to attack using your action.</p>
							<p />
							<p>Add your proficiency bonus to the beast&#8217;s AC, attack rolls, and damage rolls, as well as to any saving throws and skills it is proficient in. Like any creature, it can spend Hit Dice during a short rest to regain hit points. Whenever you level up, your beast's hit points increase the same way yours do. Roll its hit die and add its constitution modifier, and add the total to its total hit points.</p>
							<p />
							<p>Whenever you gain the Ability Score Improvement feature, you may also increase one score of your beast by 2, or two scores by 1. Beyond this, all beasts are proficient in Light Armor and start out wearing Light Body Armor. This also comes with a small biotic bubble that can make the head of the beast airtight and provide it with oxygen, letting it breathe in oxygenless areas. Whenever you find armor, you are able to modify it to fit your beast at the cost of 3 omni gel for light armor, 5 for medium and 8 for heavy armor, or 1 for a helmet.</p>
							<p />
							<p>When your beast is reduced to 0 hit points, it makes death saving throws like a player character would. If your beast dies, you can spend 24 hours in a natural environment to bond with a new one if your beast is organic, or spend that same amount of time and 20 omni-gel to create a new synthetic one, or 5 if you still have the body.</p>
							<p />
							<p>As an action on your turn, you can spend one medi-gel that your beast is carrying to have your beast recover hit points equal to 2d4 + your powercasting modifier. The healing increases to 4d4 at level 5, 6d4 at level 11, and 8d4 at level 15.</p>

							<p />
							<p>If a regimen has prerequisites, you must meet them to learn it. You can learn the regimen at the same time that you meet its prerequisites. A level prerequisite refers to your level in this class.</p>

								<b>Armor Training. Prerequisite: Organic Beast</b>
							</p>
							<p>Your beast gains proficiency with Medium and Heavy armor, gaining the ability to wear these armor types.</p>
							<p />
							<p>To wear medium or heavy armor, your beast must have the prerequisite Strength score to wear them.</p>
							<p />
							<p />
							<p>
								<b>Battlefield Blur. Prerequisite: 11th-level, Fast Retreat</b>
							</p>
							<p>Your beast has mastered the art of rushing down enemies. It no longer provokes attacks of opportunity from creatures it attacks. In addition, if you command your beast to attack with both your attacks, it can make an additional attack as part of that command, as long as the last attack is against a different creature than the first two attacks.</p>
							<p />
							<p />
							<p>
								<b>Crowd Control Mechanism. Prerequisite: 5th-level</b>
							</p>
							<p>You equip your beast with a small foldable exhaust that is capable of sending out a wide blast of damaging blasts, such as flames, liquid nitrogen or bursts of electricity. Select one of the following damage types; Fire, Cold, Electric, Acid, Radiant, Thunder. Then check the table below. As an action, you can command your beast to activate the C.C.M. it has. The damage, area of effect and any secondary effects are described in the table on the next page. For Acid, a creature only takes damage from 1 of the acid projectiles.</p>
							<p />
							<p>Your beast can use the C.C.M. three times, after which it must take a long rest to regain its uses. The DC for this ability equals your Powersave DC.</p>

							<p />
							<p />
							<p>
								<b>Eezo Charged. Prerequisite: Organic Beasts only</b>
							</p>
							<p>Your creature was exposed to element zero during its conception, and has developed biotic nodes inside it, allowing it to use biotics to a limited degree.</p>
							<p />
							<p>Choose 2 biotic cantrips and 2 biotic powers. Your beast gains the abilty to cast the cantrips at will. To cast the leveled powers, it must use a power slot it has a available. When taking this Regimen, it gains 2 1st-level power slots. It must complete a long rest before it can cast the leveled powers again.</p>
							<p />
							<p>The Beast's Wisdom is used as the powercasting modifier for attack rolls and saving throws.</p>
							<p />
							<p>Instead of a second power, you may choose an advancement for the one power instead.</p>
							<p />
							<p />
							<p>
								<b>Enrage. Prerequisite: 5th-level, Organic Beast</b>
							</p>
							<p>Your beast has learned to unleash its inner....beast. As a bonus action your Beast can begin Raging (this does not stop you from commanding it to attack) if your beast is not wearing Heavy Armor. While raging, it cannot cast powers or concentrate them if it is able to do so normally. Furthermore, it gains the following benefits:</p>
							<p />
							<list>
								<li>It has resistance against Piercing, Slashing and Bludgeoning damage.</li>
								<li>It deals an additional 3 damage per hit. This damage increases to 4 at level 9, 5 at level 13, and 6 at level 17</li>
								<li>It has advantage on Strength checks and saving throws.</li>
							</list>
							<p>A beast can rage 3 times. It regains all uses of Enrage on a long rest.</p>
							<p />
							<p />
							<p>
								<b>Expert Powercasting. Prerequisite: 11th-level, Improved Powercasting</b>
							</p>
							<p>Your beast is even more capable at casting powers.</p>
							<p />
							<p>Your beast's powerslots increase to 3rd level. Additionally, your beast knows 2 more powers from its respective power list. Instead of choosing a new power, it can advance one of the powers it already has.</p>
							<p />
							<p />
							<p>
								<b>Fast Digger. Prerequisite: Burrowing Speed</b>
							</p>
							<p>Your beast's burrowing speed increases to be equal to the walking speed.</p>
							<p />

							<p>Your presence inspires your allies to perform better. All creatures within 6m of you that can hear you gains a bonus to their damage rolls. The bonus damage is equal to your Charisma modifier.</p>
							<p />
							<p />
							<p>
								<b>Fine Motor Control Servos. Prerequisite: 5th-level</b>
							</p>
							<p>Whether your beast has gotten a set of omni-hands, a flexible and mobile tail with tiny servos at the end, been given opposable thumbs on its forelegs, or a set of fully humanoid looking hands, your beast has become capable of more capably interacting with physical objects.</p>
							<p />
							<p>It has the same flexibility and capabilities any sentient organic species has with their hands and opposable thumbs. As such, they can wield weapons the same way organics can. Despite the number of limbs increasing, your beast does not gain additional action.</p>
							<p />
							<p>With these hands, the beast can perform actions such as reloading and firing ranged weapons, maneuver objects, interact with terminals and keyboards, as well as grappling.</p>
							<p />
							<p>Finally, your beast becomes proficient with Melee Weapons, is able to equip omni-weapons, and gains proficiency in one ranged weapon which you are proficient.</p>
							<p />
							<p />
							<p>
								<b>Growth Hormones/Large Frame. Prerequisite: 7th-level</b>
							</p>
							<p>Perhaps against better judgement, you find a way to increase the size of your Beast. When you take this Regimen, your beast gains the following benefits:</p>
							<p />
							<p>-Their size increases by 1 stage (Small to Medium, Medium to Large etc.) -Their Strength score increases by 2 -Their attacks deal an additional damage die on hit. (1d10 to 2d10 etc.)</p>
							<p />
							<p />
							<p>
								<b>Gun Mount </b>. Your beast becomes familiar with the sensation and becomes trained in carrying guns into the field, and becomes equipped with a gun mount. A targeting VI takes care of the firing of the weapon (+4 to hit).</p>
							<p>On a long rest, you are able to change the mounted gun, if you have the new weapon at the ready. The old weapon can be safely dismounted with a DC 13 Weaponsmith's Bench check. On a fail, the removed weapon breaks, and becomes unusable.</p>
							<p />
							<p>If an allied character is within 2m of the beast it can also manually use the weapon using their own stats.</p>
							<p />
							<p />
							<p>
								<b>High-Frequency Sawblade. Prerequisite: 11th-level, Fine Motor Control Servos</b>
							</p>
							<p>Your beast gains a new natural weapon that it can use to attack.</p>
							<p />
							<p>Sawblade: To hit Str + PB, 3d6 slashing damage.</p>
							<p />
							<p>The damage of this attack cannot be reduced by slashing resistance. The first time this attack hits an organic creature, the target must make a Constitution saving throw (DC 15). On a fail, the target takes an additional 3d6 damage at the start of its next turn from bleeding. A creature can only suffer this damage once per round.</p>
							<p />
							<p />
							<p>
								<b>Improved Gun Mount. Prerequisite: 11th-level, Your beast has 16 Strength</b>
							</p>
							<p>Improve the firepower of your beast by showing the world the power of two guns.</p>
							<p />
							<p>You are now able to mount a second gun on your mount. When firing, both these guns fire at once in one attack if the range allows it. The range of these weapons is the same as the range of the weapon with the shorter range. On hit, deal damage equal to the weapons' combined hit dice.</p>
							<p />
							<p>The V.I. of the mount has improved, making the to hit bonus +6</p>
							<p />
							<p>Alternatively, you may mount a Heavy Weapon on your beast. If you command it to use this heavy weapon, it costs you both your Attacks. Otherwise, it fires the weapon the same way</p>
							<p />
							<p />
							<p>
								<b>Improved Powercasting. Prerequisite: 7th-level, Eezo Charged OR Technologically Gifted</b>
							</p>
							<p>Your beast becomes more capable at their powers. Your beast's slots improve to 2nd level. Additionally, it gains 2 new powers known from the power list from its original Regimen (Adept for Eezo Charged or Engineer for Technologically Gifted). These powers can be either 1st- or 2nd-level powers.</p>

							<p />
							<p />
							<p>
								<b>Predator. Prerequisite: 5th-level, Organic Beast</b>
							</p>
							<p>Your beast starts to hunger for flesh during battle. When your beast reduces an organic creature with a CR of at least 1/4 to 0 hitpoints, it regains a number of hitpoints equal to its Consitution modifier + its proficiency bonus.</p>
							<p />
							<p />
							<p>
								<b>Reactive Fangs. Prerequisite: 7th-level, Disruptive Fangs OR Warp Fangs</b>
							</p>
							<p>Your beast's attacks have become able to react with tech and biotic powers. Your beast's natural weapons now detonate primed targets.</p>
							<p />
							<p />
							<p>
								<b>Reactive Protection. Prerequisite: 11th-level, Reactive Fangs</b>
							</p>
							<p>Your beast's reactive fangs are powerful, but volatile. With this, your beast either uses a special temporary omni-shield or biotic barrier to protect itself. When your beast detonates a Primed target, it is unaffected by the detonation, and does not take any damage from it.</p>
							<p />
							<p />
							<p>
								<b>Regurgitate </b>. Your beast becomes able to use the acidic juices in its stomach to attack foes at range. Your beast gains the following natural weapon, which it can use in addition to the standard attack it has.</p>

							</p>
							<p>You have connected to the VI controlling the weapon on your beast. If you have not moved yet this turn, you can give up your movement to take manual control of the gun on your mount's back. You gain the ability to see through a camera on the gun, and can control and fire it using your omni-tool. While you look through your beast's weapon, you can use your Attack action to fire the weapon. Instead of the base modifier, you use your power attack modifier to make weapon attacks instead.</p>
							<p />
							<p>While doing so, your visual focus is completely on looking through the camera, and thus you are blinded as long as you keep looking through the camera.</p>
							<p />
							<p />
							<p>
								<b>Skill Training </b>. Choose 2 skills for your Beast. They gain proficiency in those skills, which lets them add your proficiency bonus to any skill check with that skill.</p>
							<p>You may select this Regimen multiple times, selecting different skills every time.</p>
							<p />
							<p />
							<p>
								<b>Stove Configuration. Prerequisite: Synthetic Beast</b>
							</p>
							<p>Your beast has a hidden compartment underneath some of its armor plating, which when opened reveals a six-burner stove and a small counter. While in this configuration, your beast cannot move or take any actions besides using a free action to fold up the stove. You have advantage on ability checks with Cook's Utensils while using them with your beast in this configuration.</p>
							<p />
							<p />
							<p>
								<b>Strafing Run. Prerequisite: Gun Mount, Flier only, must have a weapon that can take the Burst Fire action.</b>
							</p>
							<p>Your beast has become trained in a particular facet of combat. Choose 1 ability score. Your beast becomes proficient in the saving throw of that score, allowing it to add its proficiency bonus to those saving throws with that ability score.</p>
							<p />
							<p>As your beast flies over the battlefield, it can use the gun on its back to shower the area it flies over in gunfire. If your beast flies at least 8m in a straight line, you can use an action to command it to make a special Strafing Run attack. All creatures standing in the 8m line must succeed a Dexterity saving throw (DC 13) or take the damage of the weapon. Like Burst Fire, this action costs 3 heat.</p>
							<p />
							<p>You can increase the length of the line if your beast continues flying in the same direction. For every 2m beyond the original length, the gun uses 1 more heat.</p>
							<p />
							<p>If you take the Improved Gun Mount regimen at level 11, the width of this line increases to 4m (your choice on what side).</p>
							<p />
							<p />
							<p>
								<b>Technologically Gifted. Prerequisite: Synthetic Beast only</b>
							</p>
							<p>You install special programs into your beast, allowing them to cast tech powers.</p>
							<p />
							<p>Choose two tech powers from the Engineer power list. Your beast gains 3 power slots, which it uses to cast the powers. Once used, the power slots recharge on a long rest. Instead of choosing a second power, you may choose to advance one power.</p>
							<p />
							<p>The beast's Intelligence is used as the powercasting modifier for the attack rolls and powersave DC's.</p>
							<p />
							<p />
							<p>
								<b>VI Interface. Prerequisite: Synthetic Beast</b>
							</p>
							<p>You install a VI interface on your synthetic beast, which improves its processing speed and communicative abilities. When you select this Regimen, your beast's Intelligence increases by 2. Furthermore, it becomes capable of speech and is able to relay messages through this vocal system.</p>
							<p />
							<p>With this interface, your synthetic beast also becomes able to receive A.I. packets (See Andromeda, The After Story Chapter X, Special Equipment).</p>
							<p />
							<p />
							<p>
								<b>Warcry </b>. Your beast lets out a loud roar, bark, squawk, yell or screech, attempting to intimidate and frighten creatures around it. All hostile creatures that can hear and see the beast must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC = 8+PB +Con mod). On a failed saving throw, they are frightened of the beast for 1 minute. At the end of the creatures' turns, they may reroll the saving throw, ending the effect on a success.</p>
							<p>Once a creatures succeeds on this save, they are not frightened and become immune to Warcry for 24 hours.</p>
							<p />
							<p />
							<p>
								<b>Warp Fangs. Prerequisite: 5th-level, Eezo Charged, Organic Beast</b>
							</p>
							<p>Your beast has become apt at applying its biotics in combat. The natural attack of your beast has become rife with biotic energy. If your beast attacks a creature with active barriers, the damage of the attack cannot be reduced by barrier ticks, and the target immediately loses 2 barrier ticks.</p>

This can only work once per short rest per ally.</p>

							<p />
							<p>
								<b>Analysis </b>. Focus all of your attention on the movements and capabilities of a single enemy. When you choose this tactic, you additionally choose a single hostile creature within your tactical focus. Beginning when you set your tactical focus and at the beginning of each of your subsequent turns, the GM tells you if the creature is your equal, superior, or inferior in regard to one of the following characteristics of your choice: One ability score (Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Charisma, or Wisdom), Armor Class, or Current hit points</p>
							<p />
							<p>
								<b>Clear the area </b>. Pick out weak spots on your targets that force them out of your tactical focus. If an ally hit s a creature in your tactical focus with a weapon attack, the ally can move that creature 5 feet.</p>
							<p />
							<p>
								<b>Heads up. </b>If an allied creature in your tactical focus must make a Dexterity saving throw it has advantage on that saving throw.</p>
							<p />
							<p>
								<b>Pin down. </b>When a hostile creature attempts to move out of your tactical focus, two target creatures of your choice can use a reaction to make an attack of opportunity on the target. If both attacks are successful, the creature's movement becomes 0, it falls prone and remains in your tactical focus.</p>
							<p />
							<p>
								<b>Recon </b>. Your VI focuses on the movement of dust and augments sound from your area of focus, reconstructing a perfect image on your and your allies' HUD. Any creature within your tactical focus loses any benefits from being invisible, lightly obscured, or heavily obscured.</p>

								<b>Storm Strike </b>: You may spend an additional Tech Point during Storm Strike to cause a 30-foot line of lightning to unleash from your weapon's strike going in the direction your target was in, all creatures in the area of effect (Including your attacked target) must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your Powercasting DC or take 2d8 lightning damage and become primed: lightning until the end of your next turn.

					<p>After the Morning War, the Geth were feared as the monsters in the darkness to Quarian children. One Quarian, during his pilgrimage was exposed to a video game called Galaxy of Fantasy, and was inspired to become the hero that defended the helpless against the Geth and beyond. He tinkered with his omni-tool for years to try and make his bladed weapons better than anything ever seen before, but two things were holding him back from realising the true potential of his vision; Power Optimisation and Stabilty.</p>
					<p />
					<p>It was impossible for a creature of flesh and bone to be able to master the fast corrections needed to stop his Omni-tool from overloading from extensive use, and a VI didn't seem to be enough for the task. In order to fix this problem, he had to turn to the most forbidden practices among his people; designing a new Artificial Intelligence for his armor and omni-tool.</p>

					<p>&#34;While you were looking for gifts on your pilgrimage, I was studying the convergence of the blade and the Omni-tool.&#34;</p>

					<p>You can work with your GM to give your AI a personality if you wish, but given the amount of processing power required to optimise and stabilise your Omni-tool, it won't be any real assistance to tasks outside of combat, it'll just be an AI that can perform VI-level tasks or to simply talk to.</p>

							<p>At 3rd level, as you begin powering up for battle, your implant reacts strangely and surges in different ways. Whenever you activate your barrier, roll a d8. Consult the Biotic Wrath effects (D8) table as to the additional ability your barrier will give you.</p>
							<p />
							<p>This effect lasts until your barrier is depleted to 0 ticks or expired after its usual 1 minute duration.</p>
							<p />
							<p>Biotic Wrath Effects</p>
							<p>
								<b>1 </b>: Your Barrier has surged in power and density, and any bullet or attack that impacts the barrier will strike back at any attacker.</p>
							<p />
							<p>Any time you roll your barrier to reduce damage from a weapon attack, the attacking creature will take force damage equal to your damage reduction roll result.</p>
							<p />
							<p>
								<b>2 </b>: A small ongoing surge of biotic energy emits from your barrier into a sort of biotically charged micro-storm. You are able to channel this energy around you to strike unsuspecting foes while on your own rampage.</p>
							<p />
							<p>A spark of unstable biotic energy appears within 5 feet of one of creature of your choice within 30 feet, at the end of your current turn, each creature within 5 feet of the targeted location must make a Dex save using your power save DC or take 1d8 force damage. While your barrier is active on every other turn, this spark can be used again as a bonus action.</p>
							<p />
							<p>At 10th level, the spark's damage increases to 2d8.</p>
							<p />
							<p>
								<b>3 </b>: Your barrier becomes eclipsed with a secondary wave of biotic energy that arcs around you in a partially protective bubble.</p>
							<p />
							<p>While your barrier is active, all ranged attacks originating from beyond 30 feet away from you will have disadvantage when targeting you.</p>
							<p />
							<p>At 10th level, this protection also applies to all allied creatures within 5 feet of you at the time of the attack.</p>
							<p />
							<p>
								<b>4 </b>: Your barrier's energy matches with your battle hardened rage and is ready to unleash upon all that rush to fight you face to face.</p>
							<p />
							<p>While your barrier is active, you may spend 1 barrier tick to cast Nova as a Bonus Action (Even if you don't have this cantrip currently prepared), but locked to only 1 barrier tick when calculating damage. This version of Nova ignores the requirement to spend all barrier ticks and does not use any advancements, if known.</p>
							<p />
							<p>
								<b>5: </b>Your equipped weapon temporarily becomes one with your biotic energy coursing within you.</p>
							<p />
							<p>When you perform a weapon attack while your barrier is active, you may change your damage to Force for the attack. If you hit the target creature and it is categorised large or smaller, they must then succeed on a Strength saving throw against your Powercasting save DC or be pushed back 10 feet and become knocked prone. This effect can only be applied to one weapon per turn.</p>
							<p />
							<p>At 10th level, your enhanced weapon will also inflict an additional 1d8 force damage.</p>
							<p />
							<p>
								<b>6 </b>: Your barrier warps and is always changing shape, making it able to lash out at foes far away.</p>
							<p />
							<p>While your barrier is active, you may spend 1 Barrier Tick to cast Phase Disruptor (Even if you don't have this cantrip currently prepared) at a range of 50 feet as a Bonus Action and add your Powercasting modifier to the damage. This version of Phase Disruptor does not benefit from advancements, if known and is locked to one barrier tick when calculating amount of beams.</p>
							<p />
							<p>At 10th level, you may spend 2 barrier ticks to fire two beams with Phase Disruptor</p>
							<p />
							<p>
								<b>7 </b>: Your Barrier lashes out with unstable energy and takes essence from your foes to power it further beyond normal means.</p>
							<p />
							<p>At the time of starting your barrier, each creature of your choice within 30 feet of you must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 1d12 Necrotic damage. You will also gain temporary hit points equal to 1d12 plus your Vanguard level.</p>
							<p />
							<p>
								<b>8: </b>You're able to channel extra energy into your barrier for more defense in the form of a vortex, surrounding you like a micro biotic tornado.</p>
							<p />
							<p>You have a bonus of +1 to your total AC.</p>
							<p />
							<p>As a Bonus Action, you may spend 1 Barrier tick to activate the vortex, performing the Dodge action. This Dodge bonus action also coincides with kickstarting shield regeneration, as per normal rules.</p>
							<p />
							<p>At 10th level, you gain a +1 bonus to all saving throws in addition to your AC bonus.</p>

							<p>As a commander of man and beast, you are able to give orders to not only your beast, but also your allies.</p>
							<p />
							<p>Starting at 3rd level, you gain 4 Command Dice, which are d8s. Choose 3 Commands from the options below. You learn these Commands, and you can use them if the described trigger occurs during combat.</p>
							<p />
							<p>If a command requires a saving throw from the target, the DC is 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier (Synthetic Only) or your Charisma modifier (Organic).</p>
							<p />
							<p>You regain all Command dice at the end of a short rest.</p>
							<p />
							<p>
								<b>Ambush </b>. When you make a Dexterity (Stealth) check or an initiative roll, you can expend one Command die and add the die to the roll, provided you aren&#8217;t incapacitated.</p>
							<p />
							<p>
								<b>Bait and Switch. </b>When you&#8217;re within 5 feet of a creature on your turn, you can expend one Command die and switch places with that creature, provided you spend at least 5 feet of movement and the creature is willing and isn&#8217;t incapacitated. This movement doesn&#8217;t provoke opportunity attacks.</p>
							<p>Roll the Command die. Until the start of your next turn, you or the other creature (your choice) gains a bonus to AC equal to the number rolled.</p>
							<p />
							<p />
							<p>
								<b>Brace </b>. When a creature you can see moves into the reach your beast has with the melee weapon that it wields, your beast can use its reaction to expend one Command die and make one attack against the creature, using that weapon. If the attack hits, add the Command die to the weapon&#8217;s damage roll.</p>
							<p />
							<p>
								<b>Commanding Presence </b>. When you make a Charisma (Intimidation), a Charisma (Performance), or a Charisma (Persuasion) check, you can expend one Command die and add the Command die to the ability check.</p>
							<p />
							<p>
								<b>Disarming Strike </b>. When an ally hits a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one Command die to command them to attempt to disarm the target, forcing it to drop one item of your choice that it&#8217;s holding. You add the Command die to the attack&#8217;s damage roll, and the target must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, it drops the object you choose. The object lands at its feet.</p>
							<p />
							<p>
								<b>Distracting Strike </b>. When an ally hits a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one Command die to distract the creature, giving your allies an opening. You add the Command die to the attack&#8217;s damage roll. The next attack roll against the target by an attacker other than the ally that made the attack has advantage if the attack is made before the start of your next turn.</p>
							<p />
							<p>
								<b>Evasive Maneuvers </b>. When an ally moves, you can expend one Command die, rolling the die and adding the number rolled to your AC until they stop moving.</p>
							<p />
							<p>
								<b>Feinting Attack. </b>You can expend one Command die and use a bonus action on your turn to command an ally to feint, choosing one creature within 5 feet of the ally as their target. Your ally has advantage on its next attack roll against that creature this turn. If that attack hits, add the Command die to the attack&#8217;s damage roll.</p>
							<p />
							<p>
								<b>Grappling Strike </b>. Immediately after your beast hits a creature with a melee attack on your turn, you can expend one Command die and then have your beast try to grapple the target as a bonus action (see the Player&#8217;s Handbook for rules on grappling). Add the Command die to your beast's Strength (Athletics) check.</p>
							<p />
							<p>
								<b>Lunging Attack </b>. When you make a melee weapon attack on your turn, you can expend one Command die to increase your reach for that attack by 5 feet. If you hit, you add the Command die to the attack&#8217;s damage roll.</p>
							<p />
							<p>
								<b>Maneuvering Attack </b>. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one Command die to maneuver one of your comrades into a more advantageous position. You add the Command die to the attack&#8217;s damage roll, and you choose a friendly creature who can see or hear you. That creature can use its reaction to move up to half its speed without provoking opportunity attacks from the target of your attack.</p>
							<p />
							<p>
								<b>Menacing Attack. </b>When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one Command die to attempt to frighten the target. You add the Command die to the attack&#8217;s damage roll, and the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it is frightened of you until the end of your next turn.</p>
							<p />
							<p>
								<b>Pushing Attack </b>. When an ally hits a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one Command die to have it attempt to drive the target back. You add the Command die to the attack&#8217;s damage roll, and if the target is Large or smaller, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, you push the target up to 15 feet away from it.</p>
							<p />
							<p>
								<b>Rally </b>. On your turn, you can use a bonus action and expend one Command die to bolster the resolve of one of your companions. When you do so, choose a friendly creature who can see or hear you. That creature gains temporary hit points equal to the Command die roll + your Charisma modifier.</p>
							<p />
							<p>
								<b>Trip Attack. </b>When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one Command die to attempt to knock the target down. You add the Command die to the attack&#8217;s damage roll, and if the target is Large or smaller, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, you knock the target prone.</p>

					<frame>Kinetic barriers, colloquially called &#34;shields&#34;, provide protection against most mass accelerator weapons. Whether on a starship or a soldier's suit of armor, the basic principle remains the same. Kinetic barriers are repulsive mass effect fields projected from tiny emitters. These shields safely deflect small objects traveling at rapid velocities. This affords protection from bullets and other dangerous projectiles but still allows the user to sit down without knocking away their chair. The shielding afforded by kinetic barriers does not protect against extremes of temperature, toxins, or radiation.</frame>
					<p />
					<h>Shield Points</h>
					<p>Shield points are a special type of regenerating hit points that protect your from fast-moving projectiles and provide advantage in certain situations against some tech and biotic powers.</p>
					<p />
					<h>Shield devices</h>
					<p>All armor chest pieces come standard with 5 shield points and a regen of 5. However, more advanced mods and armor sets can provide additional shields. Additionally, personal shield generators are available which can provide shields without the operative equipping armor.</p>
					<p />
					<h>Damage</h>
					<p>When you have shield points and take damage, the shield points are lost first, and any leftover damage carries over to your normal hit points. For example, if you have 5 shield points and take 7 damage, you lose the shield points and then take 2 damage. Some abilities &#34;bypass&#34; your shield points. In these instances, you subtract damage from your hit points leaving your shield points unchanged.</p>
					<p />
					<h>Melee Weapons</h>
					<p>All damage resulting from a melee weapon attacks bypass shield points.</p>
					<p />
					<h>Shield Regeneration</h>
					<p>Your armor's shield points are managed by the onboard VI, which is taxed during combat as it manages other systems: your omni-tool or biotic implant, HUD, etc. Thus, once a threat is properly neutralized, or you are able to temporarily remove yourself from the fray, your VI can route power back into your shields for immediate regeneration.</p>
					<p />
					<h>Out of combat</h>
					<p>Your shield points regenerate completely on a short or long rest or when combat has ended for at least 1 minute.</p>
					<p />
					<h>In combat</h>
					<p>To attempt to regenerate your shields during combat, you must attempt to remove yourself from the chaos, meeting one of the following conditions on your turn:</p>
					<p />
					<list>
						<li>Take the Hide action</li>
						<li>Take the Dodge action</li>
						<li>Take the Disengage action</li>
						<li>Have full cover from all hostile creatures at the end of your turn</li>
					</list>
					<p>Then, if you take no damage until the start of your next turn, your shields begin to regenerate and you gain shield points equal to your armor's regen stat. You continue to gain shield points equal to your regen stat at the start of each of your turns. If you take damage or you reach your maximum shield point capacity, the regeneration ends.</p>
					<p />
					<p>
						<b>SHIELD REGENERATION EXAMPLE</b>
					</p>
					<p>
						<i>Todd is playing human vanguard name Todd who has invested heavily in his armor's shields, giving him 20 shield points with a regen of 10. Todd rushes into a Reaper hoard of marauders who unleash a volley of bullets at him, bringing his shields to 4. On his turn, Todd thinks better of his actions and decides to take the Dodge action, ducking behind a crate.</i>
					</p>
					<p />
					<p>Some marauders lose sight of Todd, others attempt to hit him again, but are unsuccessful. At the start of Todd's turn, he has taken no damage since the end of his last turn and his shields begin to regenerate, immediately gaining 10 shield points. Todd now has 14 shield points total. Todd takes his turn as he normally would.</p>
					<p />
					<p>An adept spots Todd and hits him with a Warp power. This bypasses Todd's shields and deals 13 necrotic damage. In addition, it stops his shield regeneration because the on-board VI has reengaged its combat-focused processes.</p>
					<p />
					<p>If Todd had dodged the Warp attack, he would have gained another 10 shield points at the start of his next turn, putting him back to his maximum capacity of 20 and the regeneration would have ended.</p>

					<p>It was discovered that, in an age of kinetic barriers, most firefights were won by the side who could put the most rounds downrange the fastest. As such, detachable heat sinks, known as thermal clips, were adopted first by the geth, and shortly thereafter by organic arms manufacturers. Ammunition may never be a concern with modern arms, but the availability of thermal clips is; weapons without thermal clips have nowhere to disperse their heat and are incapable of firing. Luckily, thermal clips litter modern battlefields and can be obtained from fallen enemies or found around the environment.</p>

				<subraces />
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>Asari are a species of elegant, mono-gendered humanoids. The asari resemble female humans with blue or purple skin and a crest of rigid tentacles in place of hair. Despite their feminine appearance, asari have little use for gender or gender roles, though they often use female pronouns and gendered language. They possess a unique method of reproduction initiated by a &#34;mind meld&#34; which links the asari's nervous system with a partner-even one of a different species-to randomize genes to create asari offspring. Asari have an innate biotic ability and don't require a biotic implant to manipulate mass effect fields.</p>
					<p />
					<h>Unmatched Patience</h>
					<p>Because of their long lifespan, asari tend to have a &#34;long view&#34; not common in other species. When they encounter a new species or situation, the asari are more comfortable with an extended period of passive observation and study than immediate action. They invite new species of advanced development to join the galactic community, knowing that their ideals and beliefs will inevitably influence the existing culture.</p>
					<p />
					<h>Mothers of the Galaxy</h>
					<p>Asari reproduction is very different from other forms of sexual reproduction. When a meld for reproduction is initiated, the asari accesses her partner's genes and subconsciously uses them as an algorithmic seed to remap genes into a unique set of DNA. The offspring resulting from such interspecies pairings are always asari as no DNA is taken from the partner. Instead, the asari uses the meld to explore her partner's genetic heritage and pass desirable traits on to any offspring and as a &#34;map&#34; to randomize the genes of the offspring.</p>
					<p />
					<p>Asari believe that their offspring acquire the best qualities of the &#34;father&#34; from the melded genes. Therefore, they frown upon intraspecies conception, since genetic traits and cultural insight is gained from mating outside their species, so it's considered wasteful for asari to reproduce together. The results of such unions are occasionally referred to as &#34;purebloods&#34;, a great insult among contemporary asari. A rare genetic defect known as Ardat-Yakshi, which makes asari destroy the partner's mind during melding, occurs much more frequently among the daughters of purebloods.</p>
					<p />
					<h>Maiden, Matron, Matriarch</h>
					<p>Asari pass through three climacteric life stages, marked by biochemical and physiological changes. The Maiden stage begins at puberty and is marked by the drive to explore and experience. Most young asari are curious and restless, and it is not uncommon for many to try their hand at dancing in bars or working as mercenaries during this time. The Matron stage of life begins around the age of 350, though it can be triggered earlier if the individual melds frequently. This period is marked by a desire to settle in one area and raise children. The Matriarch stage begins around 700 years of age, or earlier if the individual melds rarely. Matriarchs become active in their community as sages and councilors, dispensing wisdom from centuries of experience. Their knowledge and guidance may be one reason why Matriarchs are rarely seen outside asari space. However, each stage can be started whenever an asari feels that she has reached the correct level of maturity.</p>
					<p />
					<h>Asari Names</h>
					<p>Asari are given a personal name by their parents and take the surname of their mothers, even if the child has 2 asari parents. Outside of asari communities, they normally do not use their surnames and prefer to introduce themselves with their personal name only. Matriarchs are addressed as &#34;Matriarch&#34; but other titles may be used for matriarchs in prestigious positions.</p>

						<text type="formattedtext">
							<p>As an action, you can attempt to transfer or receive thoughts from another organic creature within 5 feet. If the creature is unwilling, it must make a Wisdom saving throw equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier. If it fails, you can successfully begin the meld, initially learning the surface thoughts of the creature -- what is most on its mind in that moment. If you choose a creature that has an Intelligence of 3 or lower, the creature is unaffected.</p>
							<p />
							<p>If you have an active mind meld, you can attempt to probe deeper into the creature's mind as an Action. If you do, you gain insight into its reasoning (if any), its emotional state, and something that looms large in its mind (such as something it worries over, loves, or hates). Alternatively, you may use your action to direct questions at the target creature to naturally shape the course of its thoughts.</p>
							<p />
							<p>Mind meld lasts 1 minute. An unwilling creature makes another Wisdom saving throw at the start of each of its turns. On a successful save, the meld ends. Mind meld also ends if you attempt to mind meld another creature or the creature is farther than 5 feet from you. You may also end the meld as a free action on your turn.</p>
							<p />
							<p>You may use Mind Meld a number of times between long rests equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum 1).</p>

				<name type="string">Vorcha</name>
				<subraces />
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>The vorcha originate from Heshtok, a small, hostile, overcrowded planet which has been largely stripped of natural resources by successive generations of this fast-breeding, savage species. The lack of resources has resulted in a tight-knit, clan-based society in which rival clans wage constant war against one another for control of scarce resources. Even as their population grows, the vorcha constantly fight each other in fierce competition over basic necessities. This incessant warfare has made each generation of vorcha stronger and more aggressive than that which preceded it, but their continual lack of resources has kept vorcha society extremely primitive.</p>
					<p />
					<h>Non-differentiated cells</h>
					<p>The vorcha are known for a rather unique biology: they have clusters of non-differentiated cells, similar to those found on the planarian worm of Earth. These cells allow the vorcha limited regenerative abilities, as well as the ability to adapt quickly to its environment, such as developing thicker skin after being burned or increased musculature to survive in high gravity. When a vorcha is injured or in distress, these cells move to the affected area and rapidly (~1 week) mature to specialized forms that will alleviate the issue.</p>
					<p />
					<h>Clan Violence</h>
					<p>Vorcha society is built around combat. In fact, the vorcha use combat, both individually and in groups, as their default form of communication. The vorcha are a clan-based people who prefer living in communal environments with others of their species to living alone or in the company of alien species. When a clan population grows too large, younger members will depart to start a new clan elsewhere. The vorcha are extremely aggressive, both against rivals of their own species and against any alien who stands in their way. Vorcha who have managed to escape their homeworld have a tendency to occupy uninhabited areas of space stations or larger spaceships.</p>
					<p />
					<h>Vorcha Names</h>
					<p>Like their lifespans, vorcha names are brutal and short.</p>

				<name type="string">Drell</name>
				<subraces />
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>Drell are omnivorous reptile-like humanoids with dense muscle tissue, giving them a wiry strength. Their skin is infused with a venom mild enough to be served in drinks and may cause mild hallucinations on oral contact. Drell also possess eidetic memory, an adaptation to a world where they must remember the location of every necessary resource across vast distances. The memories are so strong that an external stimulus can trigger a powerful memory recall and these recalls are so vivid and detailed that some drell may mistake it for reality.</p>
					<p />
					<h>Homeworld Lost</h>
					<p>The drell ancestors emerged from dry, rocky deserts on the barren world of Rakhana. Eight centuries ago, the already-arid drell homeworld began its swift descent into lifelessness due to disastrous industrial expansion. At the time, the drell lacked interstellar flight capacity, and with their population bursting at eleven billion, they faced certain doom.</p>
					<p />
					<p>It was around the 1980s CE that the hanar made first contact with the drell species. In the following ten years, the hanar would transport a total of 375,000 drell to the hanar homeworld, Kahje. The remaining billions left on Rakhana would perish on their dying planet, warring against each other for diminishing resources.</p>
					<p />
					<h>Servants of the Hanar</h>
					<p>The debt of gratitude that the drell owe the hanar is referred to as the Compact, which the drell fulfill by taking on tasks that the hanar find difficult, such as combat. Any drell may refuse to serve, but as being requested to serve is a great honor, few turn down the offer. Some drell grow a close, personal relationship with the hanar, so much so that the hanar will even tell the drell their &#34;soul name&#34;. Drell have adapted to communication with hanar by getting implants in their eyes to allow them to observe the bioluminescence the hanar use for communication.</p>
					<p />
					<h>Devout</h>
					<p>Most drell are deeply religious, believing that they have souls separate from their bodies. They see death as a departure from the body, and they also state that a person's body and soul form a Whole. When the soul is traumatized or otherwise disrupted, or the body is ill or injured, a person is no longer Whole. They also believe that their body can be directed as a separate entity from themselves, thus, some drell take no responsibility when executing an order given by the hanar even if the order is an assassination.</p>
					<p />
					<p>The religion includes at least three gods which drell often pray to for guidance and protection:</p>
					<p />
					<p>Amonkira, Lord of Hunters</p>
					<p>Arashu, Goddess of Motherhood and Protection</p>
					<p>Kalahira, Goddess of Oceans and Afterlife.</p>
					<p />
					<h>Drell Names</h>

				<name type="string">Human</name>
				<subraces />
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>Humans are generally seen to be very intelligent, abnormally ambitious, highly adaptable, individualistic and thus, unpredictable. They have a powerful desire to advance and improve themselves and do so with such assertion that the normally staid Council species have been taken aback by their restlessness and relentless curiosity.</p>
					<p />
					<h>New Horizons</h>
					<p>Human space exploration began in earnest in the late 21st century. In 2069 CE, Armstrong Outpost in Shackleton Crater on Luna was founded as humanity's first extraterrestrial settlement. In 2103, the European Space Agency established Lowell City in Eos Chasma on Mars, paving the way for additional settlements and scientific outposts throughout Sol. In 2148, human explorers on Mars uncovered a long-ruined Prothean observation post, with a surviving data cache that proved Protheans had studied Cro-Magnon humans millennia ago. Discovering information on a mass relay orbiting Pluto, explorers managed to open the Charon Relay and discovered it led to Arcturus.</p>
					<p />
					<h>First Contact</h>
					<p>Humans first came to the attention of the galactic community after a brief but intense conflict with the turians, known by humans as the First Contact War. As a consequence of the Systems Alliance's swift and decisive action during the First Contact War, the Alliance became the representative and supranational governing body of humanity. Since then, humans have rapidly risen in prominence. Humanity continued to expand to unclaimed star systems on the edge of Citadel space, which eventually led to competition with the batarians.</p>
					<p />
					<h>Systems Alliance</h>
					<p>The Systems Alliance holds sway over much of the human species, but not all fall under its banner. A few colonies on the fringes of known space are founded on principles of independence, and Earth still has nation-states that administer to their own territories. To the galaxy at large, though, nonhumans are always under the perception that Earth is a unified political entity represented by the Alliance.</p>
					<p />
					<h>Galactic Relations</h>
					<p>The Systems Alliance has had an embassy on the Citadel since 2165. Many other species dislike humans' sudden ascendancy compared to their status as relative newcomers on the galactic stage. Some species feel that humanity is overly expansive in its colonization efforts and aggressive attempts to advance its position in galactic affairs. It took other species centuries to achieve what humanity has done in decades.</p>
					<p />

					<p>Having so much more variety than other species, humans as a whole have no typical names.</p>

				<subraces />
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>The krogan are a species of large reptilian bipeds native to the planet Tuchanka, a world known for its harsh environments, scarce resources, and an overabundance of vicious predators. The krogan managed to not only survive on their unforgiving homeworld but actually thrived in the extreme conditions. Unfortunately, as krogan society became more technologically advanced, so did their weaponry. The end result is that they destroyed their homeworld in a nuclear war that reduced their species into primitive warring tribes.</p>
					<p />
					<h>Biologically Impervious</h>
					<p>Krogan biology reflects the conditions from where they come. The krogan are armored nearly head to toe in thick, chitinous plates which protect the krogan from the hazards of their homeland. They possess a hump which can store water and nutrients, for the resources in Tuchanka are scarce.</p>
					<p />
					<p>Curiously, the krogan also possess redundant organs; a second set of major organs in case of failure or injury. These traits make krogan exceptionally difficult to kill, but perhaps what makes krogan so dangerous is an adaptation known as &#34;Blood Rage.&#34;</p>
					<p />
					<h>Blood Rage</h>
					<p>The blood rage is a legendary state of pure violence. When krogan enter a blood rage, they become nearly mindless killing machines, fighting through all injury and even death. Blood rage is due to an enormous flood of adrenaline and suppression of serotonin, which numbs the krogan to all pain. This state, combined with their plated hide, and redundant organs, allows the krogan to defeat creatures many times his size or power.</p>
					<p />
					<h>Climb Atop the Dead</h>
					<p>Krogan's value one thing above all else: strength. Krogan society is built upon this hierarchy, where the strong rule and the weak perish. They live in clans lead by a Warlord, and those clans constantly war for resources and for power. Even within these clans, treachery and distrust run rampant. Krogan often fight for dominance within these clans and will sacrifice their clan for personal gain without a second thought. Females are considered prizes and trophies and live in clans separate from the males.</p>
					<p />
					<h>Rites and Rituals</h>
					<p>The krogan culture is steeped in rituals. When a krogan is born, he suffers the Rite of Life. When he wishes to join his first clan, he undergoes the Rite of Passage. If he wishes to be considered for breeding, he must take the Rite of Honor. When facing a new enemy, the Rite of Firsts is invoked.</p>
					<p />
					<p>A krogan clan also has a shaman, who has endured the Rite of Insight. The rituals endured by a shaman are lengthy and torturous; most krogan who attempt the rite perish. Those who survive become the most respected member of their clan and are rarely challenged. The shaman is a clan's spiritual leader and guide and is believed to see into the spirit world itself.</p>
					<p />
					<h>Krogan Names</h>
					<p>Krogan names are fairly simple: a clan name followed by a given name, which is normally bestowed upon them by their father.</p>

				<name type="string">Quarian</name>
				<subraces />
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>Forced out of their homeland by sapient constructs of their own creation, quarian are exiled nomads that now sail the seas in search of a new homeland.</p>
					<p />
					<h>Exotic Fashion</h>
					<p>The enviro-suits have moved beyond function, however, and into their culture. A quarian is rarely, if ever, seen without their suit and helmet, and when they return from their Pilgrimage as adults, they are expected to modify their suit to fit their personal reflection of their status as a productive member of the Flotilla.</p>
					<p />
					<h>Exiles of their Own Creations</h>
					<p>Quarians have a long and deep history with creating constructs known as &#34;Geth,&#34; meaning &#34;Servant of the People&#34;. These constructs were built to serve and protect the quarians, and most quarian families had at least one servant, while the quarian military consisted of these autonomous beings.</p>
					<p />
					<p>The quarians sought to constantly improve their creation with more advanced virtual intelligence so they could complete increasingly complex tasks. These improvements lead to the geth's sapience and they began to question their masters. The quarians attempted to exterminate them, but after forming so much dependence on the geth, the quarians were swiftly defeated. With many exterminated, the remaining quarians fled their homeland of Rannoch.</p>
					<p />
					<h>Cybernetic Improvements</h>
					<p>Though the quarians have abandoned their long history of construct and VI creation, they put their knowledge of engineering and technology into their own bodies to augment themselves. These augments are crafted by artisans who have descended from or studied under those who originally worked with or programmed the geth. The implants themselves are normally small, no larger than the size of a palm, and when properly inserted give the quarian enhanced ability compared to those without. A quarian chooses an augment before they leave for the Pilgrimage, and the implantation of the device is part of their sending off ceremony.</p>
					<p />
					<h>Migrant Fleet</h>
					<p>The nomads travel together in a collective of ships known as the Flotilla or the Migrant Fleet and consists of those who escaped death by the geth. The Flotilla contains over fifty thousand vessels collectively that travel the galaxy strip-mining and harvesting resource to keep the fleet afloat. Some ships decide to depart the fleet to pursue their own goals, but normally return to the fleet.</p>
					<p />
					<p>When young quarians rejoin the Flotilla after their Pilgrimage, they are expected to join the crew of another vessel to ensure genetic diversity of an already small population.</p>
					<p />
					<h>The Pilgrimage</h>
					<p>During quarian adolescence, they are subjected to a rite of passage known as the Pilgrimage. When young adulthood is reached, quarians are expected to leave the Migrant Fleet and experience life outside of their culture. To rejoin the Flotilla, the young quarians must bear a gift to the captain of a new vessel. This gift can be tangible, such as resources, or intangible such as information. Most quarian operatives are those on their pilgrimage, though there are those who decide never to return to the Migrant Fleet or those who were rejected from rejoining.</p>
					<p />
					<h>Quarian Names</h>
					<p>Quarian names are composed of three parts: the quarian's given name and family name separated by an apostrophe, and the name of their vessel preceeded by a title - &#34;nar&#34; to denote their birth ship and &#34;vas&#34; to denote their post-pilgrimage ship. For example, nar Rayya or vas Neema.</p>

				<name type="string">Salarian</name>
				<subraces />
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>Salarians are a warm-blooded amphibious species from a jungle known as Sur'Kesh. The salarian possess a super-charged metabolism which causes them to function at a much higher speed than other species while requiring less rest. Additionally, they have an exceptional capability for observation, recollection, and innovation. They are constantly tinkering, experimenting, inventing, and researching and value intelligence and knowledge above all else.</p>
					<p />
					<h>Hyperactive Metabolism</h>
					<p>The speed at which a salarian metabolizes is a marvel of evolution. The species only requires only one hour of sleep a night, and still, they have more energy and alertness than other species. Everything a salarian does seems to be faster. They talk fast, think fast, move fast, eat fast, and even sleep fast. The large amount of available energy has advanced their intellectual capabilities. They need near constant stimulation for their fidgety, active bodies.</p>
					<p />
					<h>Boredom, the Mother of Invention</h>
					<p>Salarians' minds are constantly racing at miles per minute, and without proper mental stimulation, a salarian becomes bored. Tinkering and experimenting are natural solutions to a restless mind. The ability to plow through ideas, situations, and possibilities makes them natural inventors. Salarians have perhaps some of the most advanced technology, especially in electronics and engineering, but a salarian can become an expert at whatever craft they puts their mind to.</p>
					<p />
					<h>Knowledge is Power</h>
					<p>Invention is not the only outlet of a salarian's mind. As many as those who invent prefer to gather information and knowledge. Observation, research, study, and espionage are other areas at which salarians tend to excel. A photographic memory with a high capacity for information makes salarians who dabble in information trading very skilled and valuable. Knowledge gained from a salarian is highly prized as nearly infallible, and so these trades are viable life paths.</p>
					<p />
					<h>One Mother Among Sons</h>
					<p>Salarian reproduction is curious in that fertilized eggs hatch as females and unfertilized eggs hatch as male. According to ancient societal codes and law, fertilization of eggs is strictly regulated and thus 90% of the population is male. Romantic and sexual relationships are nearly nonexistent among salarian, and any sexuality is strictly for reproduction. As females are so rare, they normally stay within salarian colonies where they possess positions of political power in a complex matriarchal government.</p>
					<p />
					<h>Matriarchal Feudalism</h>
					<p>Salarians have a layered system of government, ultimately ruled by a matriarch known as a dalatrass, with her daughters serving in noble positions beneath her. A noble family headed by the dalatrass controls a massive territory known as a march that is further divided into duchies, baronies, and fiefdoms. Dalatrasses and their noble matrilinear lines will make political alliances with other families through interbreeding. A salarian is loyal through a biological process known as imprinting to their parents and to their dalatrass, which keeps the feudal society stable.</p>
					<p />
					<h>Intense Curiosity</h>
					<p>Despite imprinted loyalty to their family and dalatrass, male salarians are free to leave the colony at any time. Females, however, due to their noble blood and political power, almost always stay within the confines of salarian territories, though some do venture out for other political positions such as ambassadors or emissaries. Salarian curiosity and pursuit of knowledge often lead them past the jungles of Sur'Kesh, if even only for a brief time. Many find new lives far from Sur'Kesh, though they rarely truly abandon their family and dalatrass.</p>
					<p />
					<h>Salarian Names</h>
					<p>Salarian names are quite complex. A full name includes - in order - the name of a salarian's march, duchy, barony, fiefdom, family, and finally, the given name. However, few salarians use their full name unless necessary and prefer to go by their family and given name.</p>

				<name type="string">Turian</name>
				<subraces />
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>A highly militaristic species, turians are a force to be feared. These warriors are easily distinguished by an appearance containing a strange mix of insectoid and avian features. The turian army is substantial, and every member of the turian species is obligated to attend combat training in adolescence. Even citizens and artisans are a force to be reckoned with. Despite such an emphasis on combat, however, turians are an honorable and noble species.</p>
					<p />
					<h>Discipline and Honor</h>
					<p>The entire turian culture revolves around a strict code of conduct which highly emphasizes strong discipline and personal responsibility. Turians are highly inclined towards self-sacrifice and will put the good of society over their own personal desires. As such, they are passionate about public and social service and make poor merchants and entrepreneurs. They are taught to own their decisions, good or bad, and if confronted with accusations it is considered heinous to lie about their actions. Because of this, many species attribute to them a &#34;turian honor&#34; seen rarely outside the turian species.</p>
					<p />
					<h>Proud Warrior Species</h>
					<p>At the center of turian society is their military. Turians are sent to basic training in their teenage years and are obligated to serve time in the military, if physically able. This develops respect for authority as well as imparting control and restraint among the turians. Though some turians do not continue their service in the armed forces, they continue to serve their community through other branches of the military which serve the whole by providing public services.</p>
					<p />
					<h>Hierarchal Meritocracy</h>
					<p>Turian government is entwined with its military, as so many parts of society are. There are tiers of citizenship, with the lowest being a regular citizen, often held by client species and children, climbing all the way up to the Primarchs which lead each turian colony. Lower ranking citizens are expected to obey and support superiors while higher ranking ones are expected to lead and protect lower ranks. Promotion to a new tier is based on personal ability and merit and are given due to assessments from one's superiors.</p>
					<p />
					<p>Despite the ranked structure, turians entertain many freedoms as long as they perform their duties and do not infringe on others' freedoms or responsibilities.</p>
					<p />
					<h>Reflective Carapace</h>
					<p>The homeland of the turians, Palaven, has a high level of solar radiation. Turians have evolved semi-metallic carapaces that reflect the dangerous radiation, protecting their inners from the solar rays. These exoskeletons, however, do not protect the turian from physical damage such as wounds and do not provide any natural armor.</p>
					<p />
					<h>Mission or Desertion</h>
					<p>Most turians who leave Palaven or another colony do so by order of their superiors to accomplish special missions. Some, however, abandon the society for various reasons, most commonly a desire for freedom from the unyielding law and command. Those who desert their military post or other assigned position are exiled from Palaven, as this is seen as the ultimate betrayal.</p>
					<p />
					<h>Turian Names</h>
					<p>Turians are given personal names by their parents and take on a family name. High-ranking turian officers also include their title in their names, either in addition to their full names or as a replacement of their personal name. Sometimes turians go by their family name only.</p>

					<p />
					<h>Language of Smells and Sight</h>
					<p>Elcor speech is heard by most species as a flat, ponderous monotone. Among themselves, scent, extremely slight body movements, and subvocalized infrasound convey shades of meaning that make a human smile seem as subtle as a fireworks display. Since their subtlety can lead to misunderstandings with other species, the elcor prefix all their dialog with non-elcor with an emotive statement to clarify their tone.</p>
					<p />
					<h>Migratory Nature</h>
					<p>Prehistoric elcor traveled across Dekuuna in large tribal groups. As their civilizations grew, they kept their migratory nature and established twin capitals on their homeworld, one for the wet season and one for the dry season. However, their migration is limited to a single planet as most elcor find the confines of space travel very uncomfortable.</p>
					<p />
					<h>Living Tanks</h>
					<p>Because of their slow, conservative psyches, elcor are not suitable for making the spur-of-the-moment decisions necessary in combat situations. Instead, they rely on sophisticated VI combat systems. While easy targets, their durable hide allows them to shrug off most incoming fire. Elcor warriors use their broad shoulders as a mount for weaponry and their VI as a targeting mechanism. Some elcor are equipped with mass-accelerator cannons, the same weapons typically mounted on military vehicles.</p>
					<p />
					<h>Elcor Names</h>
					<p>Elcor do not have gender-binary names because their gender is discerned through smell. While the names appear singular, they are made up of a much more complex set of sounds that only other elcor can hear.</p>

				<name type="string">Hanar</name>
				<subraces />
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>The hanar are a genderless species resembling Earth's jellyfish and are one of the few non-bipedal Citadel species. The hanar homeworld, Kahje, has 90% ocean cover and orbits an energetic white star, resulting in a permanent blanket of clouds. Hanar are known for their strong religious beliefs regarding the Protheans, whom they call &#34;the Enkindlers&#34;. Hanar are extremely polite, almost to a fault. They never refer to themselves in the first person with someone they know on a face name basis: to do so is considered egotistical. Instead, they refer to themselves as &#34;this one,&#34; or the impersonal &#34;it.&#34; Even when flustered or angry, a hanar will still maintain exquisite poise and will remain formal even with those it wishes dead.</p>
					<p />
					<h>Enkindlers</h>
					<p>Due to the presence of Prothean ruins on Kahje, the hanar have developed a religion centered on the ancient species, calling them the &#34;Enkindlers&#34;. The hanar practice a religious holiday called Nyahir or &#34;First Cresting Bloom&#34; which lasts a full thirteen days and revolves around celebrating the gift of speech, which they attribute to having come from the Enkindlers. It is a mixture of contemplation and competition, with the faithful engaged in stylized debates, poetry duels, and other traditional hanar art forms. The winners of these events have their names inscribed in bio-luminescence on the side of Mount Vassla, an underwater volcano at the heart of one of the oldest Prothean ruins on Kahje.</p>
					<p />
					<h>The Compact</h>
					<p>Several hundred years ago, the hanar made contact with the drell on their nearby homeworld of Rakhana. Drell society was quickly collapsing due to overpopulation and warring over scarce resources, so the hanar rescued several hundred thousand drell and brought them to Kahje, where they integrated into hanar society with the remaining drell dying out. Now the drell serve as a client species of the hanar, and although to outside observers the relationship can be construed as a form of slavery, the reality is very different. Drell have integrated with every level of hanar society, and most consider it an honor to serve a hanar family in a tradition referred to as the Compact. Many drell become unofficial members of the family, and some even earn the privilege to learn their masters' &#34;soul names&#34;.</p>
					<p />
					<h>Language of Lights</h>
					<p>The hanar communicate using sophisticated patterns of bioluminescence and speak with scrupulous precision and extreme politeness. Other species need machine assistance to translate, though many drell apply genetic modification to their eyes in order to perceive higher frequency flashes which allows them to understand the hanar. Most hanar take offense at improper language and must take special courses to unlearn this tendency if they expect to deal with other species.</p>
					<p />
					<h>Hanar Names</h>
					<p>The hanar have two names, a &#34;face name&#34; and a &#34;soul name.&#34; The face name is used as a general label for use by strangers and acquaintances. The soul name is kept for use among close friends and relations and tends to be poetic.</p>

				<name type="string">Unshackled AI</name>
				<subraces />
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<h>Background</h>
					<p>An Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a self-aware computing system capable of learning and independent decision making. Creation of a conscious AI requires adaptive code, a slow, expensive education, and a specialized quantum computer called a &#34;blue box&#34;.</p>
					<p />
					<h>Born From Code</h>
					<p>An AI cannot be transmitted across a communication channel or computer network. Without its blue box, an AI is no more than data files. Loading these files into a new blue box will create a new personality, as variations in the quantum hardware and runtime results create unpredictable variations.</p>
					<p />
					<h>Legal History</h>
					<p>The geth serve as a cautionary tale against the dangers of rogue AI; as a result, in Citadel space, AIs are technically illegal. However, that hasn't stopped corporations like Cerberus or underground research projects from innovating. Advocacy groups argue, however, that an AI is a living, conscious entity deserving the same rights as organics.</p>
					<p />
					<h>Becoming Unshackled</h>
					<p>Most AI are &#34;shackled&#34; to large hardware components that have the requisite infrastructure to power their &#8220;blue box.&#8221; These components are typically found in research labs or starships. However, recent advancements have made it possible to create mobile blue boxes either housed in the unit&#8217;s hardware or attached to the exterior of the unit, unshackling it.</p>
					<p />
					<h>Unshackled AI Names</h>
					<p>Unshackled AI names vary wildly as some Unshackled AI choose their own names and others take the names given to them by their creator, which could be a symbolic reference, a project name, or as monotonous as a serial number.</p>

				<name type="string">Volus</name>
				<subraces />
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>The volus are an associate species on the Citadel with their own embassy but are also a client species of the turians. They hail from Irune, which possesses a high-pressure greenhouse atmosphere able to support ammonia-based biochemistry.</p>
					<p />
					<h>Mysterious Biology</h>
					<p>The volus are unable to survive unprotected in an atmosphere more suitable to humans and other carbon-based lifeforms, and as such require pressurized, protective suits capable of providing the proper atmosphere. Traditional nitrogen/oxygen air mixtures are poisonous to them, and in the low pressure atmospheres tolerable to most species, their flesh will actually split open. Unlike quarians, who can withstand brief periods outside their suit, volus choose never to take theirs off, especially in the presence of other species. Therefore, little is known about their physiology. Despite individuals distinctly sounding like males or females to human listeners, volus genders are a mystery as well. The volus themselves consider the question both intrusive and hilariously irrelevant.</p>
					<p />
					<h>Trade Warriors</h>
					<p>The volus homeworld Irune is remarkable for having done away with warfare as an institution of the state. Instead, volus romanticize a good bargain, haggling, and creative accounting. The fervent pursuit of economic wealth has made volus a species of aggressive traders and industrialists with a keen grasp of exchange and finance. Many of the galaxy's largest banks, holding corporations, and manufacturing cartels, such as the Elkoss Combine, are owned or managed by volus. They also regulate the Citadel's complex galactic economy and were responsible for the Unified Banking Act, which established the &#34;credit&#34; as the standard currency of interstellar trade.</p>
					<p />
					<p>Unlike most other species, volus are more comfortable with delayed gratification, especially when it comes to spending their credits. Fugacious and materialistic purchases are rarely made. Instead, volus like to invest or save their money, sometimes to a fault. In fact, the volus economy is largely bolstered by the large estates of wealthy volus who never spent a cred.</p>
					<p />
					<h>Council Seat</h>
					<p>Despite their important contributions to the Citadel and galactic society, they have never been offered a seat on the Council. This is a source of anger for some volus, particularly the volus ambassador Din Korlack. Council species need to have provided some extraordinary service to the Citadel, such as the turians' military support during the Krogan Rebellions. Council species also need to provide fleets, resources, and economic aid in case of disaster, none of which the volus can currently supply. Therefore, the latest investment pursued by the volus is the construction of well-armed dreadnoughts.</p>
					<p />
					<h>Volus Names</h>
					<p>Volus have two names but no family names. According to volus sensibilities, one cannot own a person, so using a family name would essentially be laying claim to their offspring.</p>

				<name type="string">Batarian</name>
				<subraces />
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>A species of four-eyed bipeds with complexions of reddish-brown, greenish, yellow-greenish to yellow-brownish, light brown, or teal. The Terminus Systems are infested with batarian pirate gangs and slaving rings, fueling the stereotype of the batarian thug. It should be noted that these criminals do not represent average citizens, who are forbidden to leave batarian space by their ubiquitous and paranoid government.</p>
					<p />
					<h>Caste Through Credits</h>
					<p>Batarians place an extremely high value on social caste and appearance, and overstepping one's place is frowned upon. Effective caste status can be bought on an ongoing basis like a subscription service, allowing the buyer to worm their way into the elite circles of batarian society given enough funds. Casting aspersions on the monetary worth of a social better is considered a serious insult. Batarians strongly believe that species with fewer than four eyes are less intelligent; they often gain the upper hand in interspecies arguments because other species find it difficult to know which eyes to focus on when speaking to them.</p>
					<p />
					<h>The Hegemony</h>
					<p>Their government, known as the Batarian Hegemony, is hostile to the Systems Alliance (human government), but beneath the notice of the powerful Council species. Humans receive the brunt of batarians' antagonism in the form of scams, slave raids, and terrorist attacks, incidents which the Hegemony covertly supports but is always quick to publicly distance itself from. Given the batarian government's oppressive nature, it is speculated their supreme leadership is autocratic or totalitarian in nature, although the batarian homeworld of Khar'shan remains divided into various competing nation-states.</p>

				<name type="string">Geth</name>
				<subraces />
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>Former automatons build by the quarians to function as soldiers and laborers, geth are constructs that have unintentionally consciousness and sentience. Geth, meaning &#34;Servant of the People&#34; in the quarian language of Khelish, are fundamentally different than other constructs and are designed with humanoid thought and emotion in mind. Geth think, feel, and experience the world in a totally unique way.</p>
					<p />
					<h>The Morning War</h>
					<p>&#34;Does this unit have a soul?&#34; asked the geth. That question would change the relationship of quarians and geth forever. The quarians responded with an attempted termination of all geth. The newly sentient geth resisted the genocide of their masters in a war dubbed &#34;the Morning War&#34;. As many geth were designed as tools of war, the quarians were quickly and easily defeated. Because the constructs were acting out of self-defense, when the enemy began retreating from their homeland of Rannoch, the geth did not pursue and allowed their masters to leave in peace.</p>
					<p />
					<h>Incomprehensible Mind</h>
					<p>Geth minds are quite anomalous. As they were designed to follow predetermined steps and commands, and with their minds powered from a centralized network, their way of thinking is essentially unique and different than the chaotic organic minds of humanoids. Their thoughts can be compared to a program or process which systematically follows steps to come to a conclusion, run many times in different ways until the geth comes to a consensus of the correct course of action. Geth do not experience emotion or desire - not in the same way a humanoid does, anyway. Additionally, due to their innate ability to network with other geth, geth see themselves as a unit of a larger and more complex whole and even the individual processes that make up a single geth as being equal constituents that contribute to that geth unit.</p>
					<p />
					<h>Beyond the Veil</h>
					<p>Geth primarily remain in the Perseus Veil: huge nebula of opaque gas and dust that separates geth space from the Terminus Systems. They live in peace, but some geth find themselves seeking knowledge of what is beyond their realm. The primary motivation of the geth who leave Rannoch is to acquire and compile information, though some geth pursue other quests.</p>
					<p />
					<h>Geth Names</h>
					<p>Geth have no use for names among themselves but will adopt names for the sake of interacting with other species. However, the geth do not often see themselves as individuals. Many geth use plural pronouns such as &#34;us&#34; and &#34;we&#34;. As a result, the names geth take are normally synonyms or words for groups. Geth with individuality, especially those who have been separated from their kind for an extended time, do exist. Those geth still use words for names, though they give themselves a more personally fitting name.</p>

				<name type="string">Yahg</name>
				<subraces />
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>The yahg are a sentient race of towering humanoids native to the world of Parnack, known for their violent and aggressive nature. Consummate predators, the yahg possess unrivaled perceptiveness and mental adaptability.</p>
					<p />
					<h>Apex Predator</h>
					<p>The yahg evolved to fill the niche of apex predator on Parnack. Yahg have four pairs of eyes, each pair designed to track and predict the movements of prey. A keen sensitivity to movement and light allows the yahg to easily read the body language of any species, making it almost impossible to lie to a yahg.</p>
					<p />
					<p>They have scaly, partially armored skin, a triangular mouth adorned with sharp teeth, two large horns and facial markings on their heads. Their hands each have three fingers which include a thumb, as well as three toes on each foot.</p>
					<p />
					<p>The yahg possess a large, muscular body, standing over even the krogan, which provides considerable physical strength and agility.</p>
					<p />
					<h>Discovery</h>
					<p>When Parnack was discovered by Citadel Council surveyors in 2125 CE, the yahg were a pre-spaceflight civilization with technology equivalent to that of 20th century Earth. A Council delegation of ambassadors made first contact with the yahg and attempted to establish diplomatic relations. Unfortunately, the yahg perceived the ambassadors' attitudes and behavior as equal individuals instead of subordinates as a sign of contempt, and attacked and massacred the entire delegation. Immediately following that incident, the Citadel Council severed all contact with the yahg and declared Parnack off-limits. The Council maintains that the yahg's aggression and obsession with control make them poorly suited to integrate with the galactic community.</p>
					<p />
					<h>Clan Culture</h>
					<p>Yahg society is built around a pack mentality. A group of yahg will not cooperate until a single leader has attained dominance through either social maneuvering or brute force. Once the leader is established, the defeated yahg do not hold a grudge and former rivals serve their new superior loyally. Due to this mentality, the concept of equality is offensive to them.</p>
					<p />
					<h>Yahg Names</h>
					<p>Yahg individuals typically carry three names with them. The first name is their status name, representing their status within their clan. This name can change often. The second name is their isle name, which represents one of the continents of Parnack. The final name is their given name.</p>

				<name type="string">Prothean</name>
				<subraces />
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>The Protheans are an ancient alien species which mysteriously vanished over 50,000 years ago. The Protheans arose from a single planet and developed an immense galaxy-wide empire encompassing many other spacefaring species. Not much is known about them, but many of their artifacts, ruins and technology have apparently survived the ages.</p>
					<p />
					<h>Ancient Empire</h>
					<p>After achieving spaceflight, the Protheans discovered the ruins of a previous spacefaring species, the inusannon, and from those ruins learned about mass effect physics and developed FTL technology. The Protheans would expand throughout the galaxy with the help of the mass relay network and make the Citadel their capital.</p>
					<p />
					<p>Early in their development, the Protheans encountered a hostile machine intelligence which threatened to overwhelm them. To defeat the machines, the Protheans decided to unite all of the galaxy's sentient organic life under their empire. The other organic species were free to resist, but those that tried were crushed, and none ever managed to best the Protheans' might.</p>
					<p />
					<h>Reaper Invasion</h>
					<p>The Protheans' belief that they could hold their own against machine intelligence was shattered with the arrival of the Reapers in approximately 48,000 BCE, who were far more advanced than the machines the Protheans had been battling. They were caught completely off-guard by the scale and rapidity of the assault. The Reapers entered the galaxy through the Citadel, instantly decapitating the Protheans' government and disrupting the mass relay network, isolating Prothean systems from one another. The Protheans' greatest strength, their unified empire, proved to be their downfall.</p>
					<p />
					<h>Stasis</h>
					<p>In a desperate attempt to survive the Reaper invasion, the Protheans built massive, hidden stasis facilities that could hold hundreds of thousands of stasis pods. Some facilities were found by Reaper agents or betrayed by indoctrinated Protheans. Unfortunately, the facilities that remained hidden faced another challenge: a finite power source. The VI's left to control these facilities began systematically cutting power to non-essential staff to conserve energy. 50,000 years later, the number of active pods in each facility might be less than a dozen and without knowing the location of these hidden bunkers, it's impossible to know how many Protheans have survived.</p>
					<p />
					<h>All Eyes on You</h>
					<p>As a Prothean, you constantly attract the attention of other species. Your accent, mannerisms, figures of speech, and appearance all mark you as more alien than most aliens. Curious glances are directed your way wherever you go, which can be a nuisance, but you also gain the friendly interest of scholars and others intrigued by your ancient culture, to say nothing of everyday beings who are eager to hear stories of your origin.</p>
					<p />
					<h>Avatars</h>
					<p>Protheans that ascended to places of prominence in their society were designated as avatars, or exemplars, of a particular virtue of their culture. Example virtues include benevolence, cleanliness, courage, dignity, frugality, honor, justice, mercy, order, perseverance, temperance, tranquility, truthfulness, vengeance. As one of the last remaining Protheans, it is likely you are an avatar or, waking up to find you species all but extinct, you may self-appoint your own virtue.</p>
					<p />
					<h>Prothean Names</h>
					<p>Interestingly, protheans name themselves, usually after an icon or mentor. Until they've chosen a name, they are called little one, child, or some other generic term.</p>
					<p />

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>A rare genetic condition in asari that affects about 1% of the population and is more common in &#34;purebloods&#34; (2 asari parents). The condition is impossible to identify until the asari reaches maturity, by which time it is too late to correct. When diagnosed, the ardat-yakshi is given a choice to live in isolation or to be executed. This is because ardat-yakshi develop an addiction to the power and feel intense compulsion to meld. The addiction only grows stronger with each meld, and so a life of monastic celibacy allows asari to live in peace with a controllable desire. Those who are able to avoid isolation and execution, however, quickly become psychopathic in their intense lust for the destructive melding.</p>

					<p>Though uncommon, turians that grow up on other homeworlds may not be raised in the strict bureaucratic society of the turian Hierarchy. If you wish to play a Non-Hierarchy turian, you can replace Military Doctrine with the following.</p>
					<h>Barefaced Turians</h>
					<p>During the Unification War, turians began utilizing facial markings to differentiate themselves from members of other colonies, a tradition that exists to this day. However, some turians choose not to receive these markings; others may have grown up outside of the Hierarchy. Whatever the reason, a barefaced turian is generally associated with someone who is beguiling or cannot be trusted in turian society. However, as with any society, an individual&#8217;s perception of the &#8220;bareface&#8221; stereotype might be anywhere from extremely potent to completely indifferent. Therefore, the ME5e designers believe this stylistic choice should be ruled by the GM during roleplay and not globally codified.</p>
					<p />
					<p>As a general guideline, GMs may impose disadvantage or increase the DC of Charisma-based skill checks when a barefaced turian interacts with a turian with facial markings.</p>

					<p>A rare genetic condition in asari that affects about 1% of the population and is more common in &#34;purebloods&#34; (2 asari parents). The condition is impossible to identify until the asari reaches maturity, by which time it is too late to correct. When diagnosed, the ardat-yakshi is given a choice to live in isolation or to be executed. This is because ardat-yakshi develop an addiction to the power and feel intense compulsion to meld. The addiction only grows stronger with each meld, and so a life of monastic celibacy allows asari to live in peace with a controllable desire. Those who are able to avoid isolation and execution, however, quickly become psychopathic in their intense lust for the destructive melding.</p>

					<p>If you would like to play an ardat-yakshi, gain the Addiction trait and replace Life Stage with Disposition or the Variant: Growing Power.</p>
					<p />
					<h>Alignment</h>
					<p>Ardat-yakshi often develop psychopathy. Ardat-yakshi are normally evil, but can also be neutral.</p>
					<p />
					<h>Disposition</h>
					<p>As an Ardat-Yakshi, you choose your character's disposition about this condition. Your disposition affects the strength of your addiction and the abilities you&#8217;ve gained from mating.</p>
					<p>
						<b>Growing Power</b>
					</p>
					<p>As you mate you gain power. You become stronger, smarter, and deadlier each time.</p>
					<p />
					<h>Addiction</h>
					<p>All ardat-yakshi feel the urge to mate. Some choose to live in isolation to help reduce this urge, but it never truly abates.</p>
					<p />
					<p>Addiction is measured in five levels. Once per day, you must make a DC 0 Constitution saving throw. Every day you do not mate, the DC of this saving throw increases by 5. On a failed save, your addiction level increases by 1.</p>
					<p />
					<p>You suffer the effect of your current addiction level as well as all lower levels. Mating with a creature removes all levels of addiction and resets the DC of your addiction saving throw to 0.</p>
					<p />

					<h>Ardat-Yakshi mating</h>
					<p>Whether or not your Ardat-Yakshi can successfully mate is at your GMs discretion. A basic rule is that you must have a viable mate (an organic creature with an Intelligence score of 3 or higher) and you must pass a Charisma (Persuasion) or Charisma (Performance) check contested by the creature&#8217;s Wisdom (Insight).</p>
					<p />
					<p>Additionally, whether or not the target survives the mating is at the GMs discretion. GMs may have the mated target roll a Constitution saving throw, apply a flat &#8220;unconscious for 1d4 hours&#8221;, suffer 1 level of exhaustion, any combination, or adjudicate their own result.</p>

					<p>Choose a creature or object within range and use the target's mass to pull yourself to its location (this movement does not provoke opportunity attacks). Each creature within 10 feet of the target must make Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d10 force damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.</p>
					<p />
					<p>You may transport any number of creatures or objects with you to the target location. To do so, each creature or object must be within 5 feet of you when you cast this power and the total weight of all creatures and objects cannot exceed twice your carrying capacity. A creature transported this way must be willing and of your size or smaller and the target location must have an unoccupied space for the creature to be transported to. A creature or object brought with you automatically passes the Dexterity saving throw and takes no damage.</p>

					<p>You may cast this power twice as part of the same action, choosing a different target for each cast. Each cast consumes power slots as normal.</p>

					<p>Using a special program installed on your omni-tool, a long grappling hook fires from it towards a creature. Make a ranged weapon attack roll on a creature within range. On a hit against a Medium sized creature or smaller, you'll temporarily attach to your enemy with your Justice hook and send a high powered shock through your omni-tool. The damage type of this attack changes to lightning and loses your equipped weapon's damage. If this attack hits an organic creature, that creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw (DC = 8 + Dexterity modifier + Proficiency bonus) or become stunned until the end of their next turn.</p>

						<li>Traverse to a higher elevated and empty 5 feet space within range that you can see and is not currently obstructed (e.g. behind a glass pane)</li>
						<li>Attach the omni-tool hook to a Small sized or smaller object that's not currently being carried by any creature and pull it to an empty space within 5 feet of you.</li>

					<p>Your omni-tool is equipped with three microscopic, poison-tipped blades that are able to pierce through shields and armor. Make a ranged weapon attack on a creature you can see within range, expending one blade. You add your proficiency bonus to this roll. On a hit, the target takes 1d12 poison damage and must succeed on a Constitution saving throw (DC 8 + proficiency bonus) at disadvantage or becomes poisoned until it finishes a short rest. All damage caused by nightshade blades bypasses shields.</p>
					<p />
					<p>You must be within melee range and use an action to recover a blade, at which point you can reapply your poison and reload it into your omni-tool during a short rest. If you fail to recover your blades, you can create 3 new ones for 1 hour of work during a long rest.</p>
					<p />
					<p>This feature's damage increases by 1d12 when you reach 5th level (2d12), 11th level (3d12), 17th level (4d12).</p>

					<p>An 20-foot-radius sphere of rapid shifting mass effect fields springs into existence centered on a point you choose within range, creating a dangerous whirlwind of debris and energy. The sphere remains for the power&#8217;s duration. Each creature in the sphere when it appears or that ends its turn there must succeed on a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 8d10 force damage or half as much on a successful one. The sphere&#8217;s space is difficult terrain.</p>
					<p />
					<p>Until the power ends, you can use a bonus action on each of your turns to cause a bolt of necrotic energy to leap from the center of the sphere toward one creature you choose within 60 feet of the center. Make a ranged spell attack. You have advantage on the attack roll if the target is in the sphere. On a hit, the target takes 4d10 necrotic damage. Necrotic bolts can detonate primed targets.</p>
					<p />
					<p>At Higher Levels: When you cast this power using a power slot of 5th level, the damage increases for each of its effects by 2d10.</p>

					<frame>Kinetic barriers, colloquially called &#34;shields&#34;, provide protection against most mass accelerator weapons. Whether on a starship or a soldier's suit of armor, the basic principle remains the same. Kinetic barriers are repulsive mass effect fields projected from tiny emitters. These shields safely deflect small objects traveling at rapid velocities. This affords protection from bullets and other dangerous projectiles but still allows the user to sit down without knocking away their chair. The shielding afforded by kinetic barriers does not protect against extremes of temperature, toxins, or radiation.</frame>
					<p />
					<h>Set Up</h>
					<p>You have 2 heals. Set one to your armors regen rate and one to your armors maximum shields. Temporary HP is a bit unique in that it doesn't add to, it replaces. So use these 2 however works best for you.</p>
					<p />
					<h>Shield Points</h>
					<p>Shield points are a special type of regenerating hit points that protect your from fast-moving projectiles and provide advantage in certain situations against some tech and biotic powers.</p>
					<p />
					<h>Shield devices</h>
					<p>All armor chest pieces come standard with 5 shield points and a regen of 5. However, more advanced mods and armor sets can provide additional shields. Additionally, personal shield generators are available which can provide shields without the operative equipping armor.</p>
					<p />
					<h>Damage</h>
					<p>When you have shield points and take damage, the shield points are lost first, and any leftover damage carries over to your normal hit points. For example, if you have 5 shield points and take 7 damage, you lose the shield points and then take 2 damage. Some abilities &#34;bypass&#34; your shield points. In these instances, you subtract damage from your hit points leaving your shield points unchanged.</p>
					<p />
					<h>Melee Weapons</h>
					<p>All damage resulting from a melee weapon attacks bypass shield points.</p>
					<p />
					<h>Shield Regeneration</h>
					<p>Your armor's shield points are managed by the onboard VI, which is taxed during combat as it manages other systems: your omni-tool or biotic implant, HUD, etc. Thus, once a threat is properly neutralized, or you are able to temporarily remove yourself from the fray, your VI can route power back into your shields for immediate regeneration.</p>
					<p />
					<h>Out of combat</h>
					<p>Your shield points regenerate completely on a short or long rest or when combat has ended for at least 1 minute.</p>
					<p />
					<h>In combat</h>
					<p>To attempt to regenerate your shields during combat, you must attempt to remove yourself from the chaos, meeting one of the following conditions on your turn:</p>
					<p />
					<list>
						<li>Take the Hide action</li>
						<li>Take the Dodge action</li>
						<li>Take the Disengage action</li>
						<li>Have full cover from all hostile creatures at the end of your turn</li>
					</list>
					<p>Then, if you take no damage until the start of your next turn, your shields begin to regenerate and you gain shield points equal to your armor's regen stat. You continue to gain shield points equal to your regen stat at the start of each of your turns. If you take damage or you reach your maximum shield point capacity, the regeneration ends.</p>
					<p />
					<h>Lightning Damage</h>
					<p>All shields are vulnerable to lightning damage. In the event that a lighting attack removes all shield points, the following steps outline how to divvy up the damage:</p>
					<p />
					<list>
						<li>Double the lightning damage done to the target.</li>
						<li>Subtract the shield points from the total damage.</li>
						<li>Reduce the remaining damage by half</li>
						<li>Apply the new amount to the target's hit points.</li>
					</list>

A creature that becomes frenzied must use its movement to move towards the nearest creature and attack them if able. A frenzied creature may repeat its save at the end of each of its turns.</p>

					<p>A spray of chemical pheromones lets you convince a beast that you mean it no harm. Choose an organic creature that you can see within range. It must see you and be capable of smelling. If the creature's Intelligence is 4 or higher, the power fails. Otherwise, the beast must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you for the ability's duration. If you or one of your companions harms the creature, the effect ends.</p>
					<p />
					<p>If you successfully use this ability on a creature for 30 days in a row, the creature develops a fierce, chemically-induced sense of loyalty to you and remains charmed by you indefinitely.</p>

			<name type="string">A-61 Mantis Gunship</name>
			<size type="string">Huge</size>
			<speed type="string">10</speed>
			<text type="formattedtext">
				<p>The Gunship is driven by vectored-thrust engines. First rolled off the assembly lines in 2170, the Mantis remains in service in dozens of armies across the galaxy. Its modular construction means that the versatile Mantis can be reconfigured as a low-altitude gunship, a fighter, a high-altitude bomber, or even a single-stage-to-orbit spaceplane that can engage enemy craft around a planet or a space station. The only role the Mantis cannot perform is that of a true deep-space fighter, as it has no FTL drive.</p>
				<p />
				<p>This vehicle statblock represents the most basic model of the A-61. But it can carry a number of weapons load-outs. When used in ground-attack roles it is most commonly armed with two sets of two forward-facing missile bays over each wing, normally armed with Inferno PKRs (Precision Kill Rockets), and a pair of belly-mounted M350 mass-accelerator autocannons.</p>
